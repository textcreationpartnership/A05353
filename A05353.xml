            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:7067:3"/>therein, and after due co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration, vſe them ſelues accordingly. Then ſhould we ſone learne and practiſe a good leſſon, to heare and ſee many thinges, and yet not to runne headlong, nor rudely and raſhly to talke of al we heare and ſee, but to talke within a compaſſe, and to referre al our talke to a temperance and ſobrietie, and to a knowen tried trueth: eſpecially where the ſaid talke may ſound to the blemiſhing and diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of any mans good name and eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>But now a daies (the more pitie) there is nothing almoſt, but that as ſone as it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued by the eye or the eare, muſt furth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with be laſſhed out againe by the mouth: ſuche a ſuperfluous and curious itching we haue, diſſolutely and vnaduiſely to talke of al matters, though they tende to the great hinderance and infamie of many of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne, and though we be nothing aſſured of the certaine trewth of the matter, yea without reſpecte to priuate or publique perſons.</p>
                  <p>Of ſuch vnbrideled talke no man or woman in our daies hath (as I ſuppoſe) more iuſte cauſe to complaine, then the right
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7067:3"/>Excellent Princeſſe, Ladie Marie Queene of Scotland: whoſe honour many haue gone about to blotte and deface, in char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging her moſte falſly and vniuſtly with the death of her late huſbande the Lorde Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley. For the defence and mainteining of whoſe innocencie in this behalfe, we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to lay forth before the gentle Reader, the moſt chief and principal reaſons, grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds and arguments, whervpon the Patrones, the Inuentors and workers of al theſe miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſe and diueliſh driftes grounded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and all their outragious doomges. And then conſequently to infringe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe the ſame. For to rehearſe, anſwere to, and repell all their aſſertions and obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, it would require a very long, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſe and a ſuperfluouſe Diſcourſe, in as muche, as theſe iolie gaie oratours, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring their dooinges more by number of falſe obiections, then by true ſubſtantial and pitthy matter, to make a goodly floriſh and a trim ſhewe, to face out and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance their craftie Iuglinges, and to couer their diſordered dealings therewithal, haue raked vp and heaped together one vpon an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>other againſt their good Maiſtres and Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne

                  <p>But in al this rablement, in al this raking and racking, what thing els do they, but vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and diſcloſe their owne ſpiteful malice and malicious ſpite, to the diſcrediting of their cauſe, and them ſelues alſo? Euen as the accuſers of Ariſtophanes among the Athenienſes did, by whome he being nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and fiue times greeuouſly accuſed, was yet euery time by the Iudges cleared and found guiltleſſe: as I do no whit doubt, but that this good innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Ladie wil be (by the verdit and ſentence of al indifferent men) ridde and vnburdened in like maner, of al maner of ſuſpicion, that theſe reprocheful men woulde by their malice and ambition bring her into (by thier willes) with al the worlde. For as goodly and as greate a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter as they make, two partes of their ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous accuſation are manifeſt falſe, and ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vntruethes and foule forged lies. The reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due thereof though in ſome part they beare trueth, and be nothing preiudicial to the Queene in this matter: yet they are ful ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniouſly and meruelous maliciouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued, drawen and wreſted to the worſt.</p>

                  <p>Secondly they pretende certaine letters, that they ſurmiſe and would haue, to haue bene written by her Grace: wherby they ſeeke to inferre againſt her many a preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, as their wily braines imagine. But the moſte weighty of them al ſeemeth to them to be her pretenſed Mariage, whereof we wil laſtly entreate.</p>
                  <p>And yet though they haue done their worſte, though they haue caſt out al their ſpite and malice againſt her: they neuer haue bene able by any direct and lawful meanes, to prooue any thing at al, wherby they may ſtaine her Graces honour in any one of the foreſaid points. Had they brought forth any ſuch neceſſarily concluding illation, we had not atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted this Defence in her behalfe: but would haue yelded and geuen place to an open knowen trewth. But ſeeing that the beſt matter they haue to ſupporte their doings withal, is nothing elſe, but preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions and ſurmiſes, which yet are not of the ſureſt and moſte probable forte, neither

                  <p>He would moreouer ſay, that he could in no wiſe wel like of that Parlament, that ſhould ſo diſhonour his owne good mother and make her to be an infamous Princeſſe,

                  <p>And now, if God ſhould (as we be al, as wel Princes, as others, ſubiect to mortall chaunces) once bereaue vs of the preſent Gouernour, the hartes and iudgementes of men being no better, nor more firmely ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and fixed towards the expectation of a certaine ſucceſsion, then they ſeme now to be: then wo and alas: it yrketh my verie harte, euen onſe to thincke vpon the immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nente and almoſt the ineuitable daunger of this our noble Realme, beinge like to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwhelmed with the raging and roring waues of mutual diſcorde, and to be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the terrible fier of ciuil diſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion.</p>
                  <p>The feare whereof is the more, by reaſon already in theſe later yeares ſome flames
<pb facs="tcp:7067:57"/>thereof haue ſparkled and fluſſhed abrode, and ſome parte of the rage of the ſayd fluddes haue already beaten vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bankes. I meane the hot contention, that hath bene therein in ſo many places, and among ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons: of bookes alſo, that haue bene ſpread abrode, and daily are ſpread, being framed affectionately, and ſounding accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſiniſter opinion of euery mans priuate appetite.</p>
                  <p>Seing therefore, that there is iuſt cauſe of feare and of great danger likely to happen by this varietie of mens iudgementes ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſely affected, as wel of meane men, as of greate perſonages: I take it the parte of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery true Engliſhman, to labour ad trauaile eche man for his poſsibilitie, and for ſuche talente, as God hath geuen him, to helpe in conuenient tyme for the preuenting of the imminent daunger. We knowe, what wit, what policie, what paines, what charges menne imploie, to prouide, that the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes or ſea doo not ouerflowe ſuch places, as be moſte ſubiecte to daunger. We knowe, what politike prouiſion is made in many good Cities and townes, both to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, that by negligence there ryſe no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7067:57"/>fiers, and yf they chaunce, with al diligence to repreſſe the rage thereof. Wherein among other his prudente doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges Auguſtus the Emperour is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for appointing at Rome ſeuen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies ordinarily to watche the Citie, for the purpoſe aforeſaide. Wherevnto he was enduced, by reaſon the Citie was in one daye in ſeuen ſeuerall places ſette on fier. And ſhal not we euery man for his his parte and vocation, haue a vigilant care and reſpecte, to the extinguiſhement of this fier already ſprong out, that may (if the matter be not wiſely foreſeen) deſtroie, ſubuert and conſume, not one Citie onely, but importe an vniuerſall calamitie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction?</p>
                  <p>Which to repreſſe, one ready and good way ſeemeth vnto me, if men may knowe and be throughly perſuaded, in what perſon the right of the ſucceſsion of the Croune of this our Realme doth ſtande and remaine. For now many men through ignorance of the ſaid Right and Title, and alſo the ſame being depraued by certaine ſiniſter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions in ſome bookes, wherevnto they haue to lightly geuen creditte, be caried
<pb facs="tcp:7067:58"/>away from the right opinion and good hart, that they otherwiſe would and ſhould haue.</p>
                  <p>The whiche kind of men I doo hartely wiſhe from their ſaid corrupte iudgemente to be reuoked: and ſhal in this Treatiſe doo my beſte indeuour, to remoue, not preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vpon my ſelf, that I am any thing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able, then others, this to do (for I knowe my owne infirmitie) but being glad and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to impart vnto others ſuch motiues, as vpon the reading of ſuch bookes, which of late haue ben ſet forth by the Aduerſaries, and after the diligent weying of diuers ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentes to the contrarie, ſeeme vnto me ſufficient to ſatisfie any honeſt and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent man, that is not obſtinately bent to his owne wilfull affections, or to ſome other ſiniſter meaning and dealing.</p>
                  <p>We ſay then and affirme, that the right Heire and Succeſſour apparent vnto the Croune of this Realme of England, is at this time ſuch a one, as for the excellent giftes of God and nature in her moſt princely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, is worthie to inherit either this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Realm, or any other, be it of much more dignitie and worthines.</p>
                  <p>But nowe I claime nothing, for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7067:58"/>of the perſon, whiche God forbid ſhould be any thing preiudiciall to the iuſte title of others. Yf moſt open and manifeſte right, iuſtice and title do not concurre with the worthines of the perſon: then let the praiſe and worthines remaine where it is, and the right where God and the lawe hath placed it.</p>
                  <p>But ſeing God, Nature and the law doth call the perſon to this expectation, whoſe intereſt and claime I do now proſequute (I meane the right excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Ladie,
<note place="margin">The Quene of Scottes is right heire apparent to the Croune of Englande.</note> Ladie Marie Queene of Scotlande) I hope, that when her right and iuſte title ſhalbe throughly heard and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered by the indifferent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if he be perſuaded already for her right, he ſhalbe more firmely ſetled in his true and good opinion, and that the other parties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a contrarie minde, ſhall finde good cauſes and groundes, to remoue them from the fame, and to geue ouer and yelde to the truthe.</p>
                  <p>Her Graces Title then, as it is moſte open and euidente, ſo it is moſte confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the lawe of God, of Nature, and of this Realme: And co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of all other Realmes in the worlde, as
<pb facs="tcp:7067:59"/>growing by the neareſt proximitie of the Roial blood. She is a Kinges and a Quee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes daughter, her ſelfe a Queene, daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the late King Iames of Scotlande, ſonne to Ladie Margarete the eldeſt Syſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to our late Soueraigne Kyng Henrie the Eight. Whoſe daughter alſo the Ladie Lenoux is, but by a later huſbande: the Ladie Frauncis, late wife to Henrie Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques Dorſette, afterwarde Duke of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke: and the Ladie Elenour, late wife to the Earle of Cumberlande, and their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genie proceedeth from the Ladie Marie, Dowager of France, yongeſt Siſter of the ſaid King Henrie, late wife to Charles Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Duke of Suffolke.</p>
                  <p>I might here fetche foorth olde farne dayes. I might reache backe to the noble and worthie Kinges long before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, of whoſe Roial blood ſhe is deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Whiche is no parte of our purpoſe, neither doth enforce her Title more then to prooue her no ſtranger within this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme. But the Argumentes and prouffes, which we meane to alleage and bring forth for the confirmation of her right and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in Succeſsion (as Heire apparent) to the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7067:59"/>Croune of England, are gathered and grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the lawes of God and nature, and not only receaued in the Ciuill policies of other nations, but alſo in the olde lawes and Cuſtomes of our owne Countrey, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon approued, and by vſage and long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of time obſerued, from the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of this Realme in politicall order vnto this preſent day.</p>
                  <p>And yet for al that hath it bene, and yet is, by ſome men attempted, artificially to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte and caſte many myſtie darke cloudes before mennes eyes, to kepe from them (if it may be) the cleare light of the ſaid iuſt ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, the which they would extinguiſh, or at the leaſt blemiſh with ſome obſcure ſhadow of lawe, but in deede againſt the lawe, and with the ſhadowe of Parlamentes, but in deede againſt the true meaning of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamentes.</p>
                  <p>And albe it, it were inough for vs (our cauſe being ſo firmely and ſuerly eſtabliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed vppon al good reaſon and lawe) to ſtande at defence, and onely to auoide (as eaſely we may) their obiections, which prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally and chiefly are grounded vpon the common lawes and Statutes of this Realme:
<pb facs="tcp:7067:60"/>yet for the bettering and ſtrengthening of the ſame, we ſhal lay forth ſundrie great and inuincible reaſons, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ioyned with good and ſufficient authoritie of the law, ſo approued and confirmed, that the Aduerſaries ſhal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be able iuſtly to impugne them. And ſo that we truſt, after the reading of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, and the effectes of the ſame wel dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, no maner of ſcruple ought to remaine in any indifferent mans hart, concerning her right and Title.</p>
                  <p>Whoſe expectation and conſcience all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we truſte fully in this Diſcourſe to ſatisfie, and doubt nothing in the worlde of the righteouſnes of our cauſe: yet muſt we nedes confeſſe, the manner and forme to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate therof to be ful of difficultie and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity. For ſuch cauſes of Princes, as they be ſeldome and rare, ſo is it more rare and ſtrange, to finde them diſcourſed, diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and determined by any lawe or ſtatute, albe it nowe and then ſome ſtatutes tende that waye.

                  <p>Ye ſay in your booke, that it is a Maxime in our lawe moſt manifeſt, that who ſo euer is borne out of England, and of father and mother not being of the obedience of the King of England, can not be capable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herite any thing in England. Whiche rule being general, without any wordes of exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, ye alſo ſay, muſt nedes extende vnto the Croune. What you meane by your law, I knowe not.

It is likewiſe a general rule, that a man attainted of felony or treaſon, his heire through the corruption of blood without pardon and reſtitution of blood,
<note place="margin">Nor that a traitour i vnable to take landes by diſcente and vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> is vnable to take any landes by diſcente.

Wherein ye confeſſe directly, that the Attainder is no diſhabilitie at all to the ſucceſsion of the Croune. For although no diſhabilitie can be alleaged in him, that hath the Croune in poſſeſsion: yet if there were any diſhabilitie in him before to receue and take the ſame by lawful ſucceſsion, then muſt ye ſay, that he was not lawful King, but an vſurper. And therfore in confeſsing Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the ſeuenth to be a lawful King, and that the Croune was lawfully caſte vppon him, ye confeſſe directly thereby, that before he was Kinge in poſſeſsion, there was no diſhabilitie in him to take the Croune by

                  <p>But in concluſion, vnderſtanding your ſelf, that this your reaſon can not mainteine your intente: you goe about an other way to helpe your ſelf, making a difference in the lawe betwene the caſe of Attainder, and the caſe of foraine byrth out of the Kinges allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce:

And for proufe therof, ye put a caſe of I.S. being ſeaſed of landes, and hauing iſſue A. and B. A. is attainted in the life of I.S. his father, and after I.S. dieth, A. liuing vnreſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:7067:65"/>Yf the Croune had bene holden of any perſon, to whome it might haue eſcheted, as in your caſe of I.S. the lande did: then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture there had bene ſome affinitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene your ſaid caſe, and the caſe of the Croune. But there is no ſuch matter.</p>
                  <p>Byſides that, ye muſte conſider, that the King cometh to the Croune, not onely by deſcente, but alſo and chiefly by ſucceſsion, as vnto a corporation. And therefore ye might eaſely haue ſene a difference in your caſes betwene the Kinges Maieſtie, and I.S. a ſubiecte: And alſo betwene landes holden of a Lorde aboue, and the Croune holden of no earthly Lorde, but of God almighty onely.</p>
                  <p>But yet for arguments ſake I would faine knowe, where you finde your differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and what authoritie you can ſhew for the prouf thereof? Ye haue made no marginal note of any authoritie: and therefore vnleſſe ye alſo ſaye, that ye are Pythagoras, I will not beleue your difference.

And Priſote, being then of Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayle with the party that claimed the lands by a deſcent, wher the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſonne was borne beyond the ſeas, durſt not abide in law vpon the title.

But if we ſhal admitte your difference to be according to the law: yet your caſes, wherevnto you applie your difference, are nothing like, as I haue ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>But to procede on in the proufe of our purpoſe, as it doth appeare, that neither the King, nor his Croune is bound by theſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rules, which before I haue ſhewed: ſo do I likewiſe ſay of al the reſidue of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rules and Maximes of the lawe,
<note place="margin">The ſuppo ſed Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime of the Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching not Kinges borne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſea, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by King Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen and King H. 2.</note> being in a manner infinite.</p>
                  <p>But to retourne againe vnto your onely ſuppoſed Maxime, whiche you make ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, concerning the diſhabilitie of perſons borne beyond the ſeas: it is very plaine, that it was neuer taken, to extende vnto the Croune of this Realme of Englande, as it
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7067:66"/>may appeare by King Stephen, and by King Henry the ſeconde, who were both ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gers and Frenchemen, and borne out of the Kinges allegeance, and neither were they Kinges children immediate, nor their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes of the allegeance, and yet they haue bene alwaies accompted lawfull Kinges of England, nor their title was by any man at any time defaced or comptrolled for any ſuch conſideration or exception of foraine birth.</p>
                  <p>And it is a worlde to ſee,
<note place="margin">The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries obiection touching King H. 2. auoided.</note> how you would ſhifte your handes from the ſaid King Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Ye ſay, he came not to the Croune by order of the lawe, but by capitulation, for aſmuch as his mother, by whome he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueied his Title, was then liuing. Well, admitte that he came to the Croune by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation, during his mothers life: yet this doth not proue, that he was diſhabled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the Croune, but rather proueth his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie. And although I did alſo admit, that he had not the Croune by order of the law during his mothers life: yet after his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers death, no man hath hitherto doubted, but that he was King by lawful ſucceſsion, and not againſt the lawes and Cuſtomes of
<pb facs="tcp:7067:67"/>this Realme. For ſo might you put a doubt in al the Kinges of this Realme, that euer gouerned ſithens, and driue vs to ſeake heires in Scotland, or els where. Whiche thing we ſuppoſe you are ouer wiſe to goe about.</p>
                  <p>Byſides this, I haue hard ſome of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries for farther helpe of their intention in this matter ſaye, that King Henry the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was à Queenes childe, and ſo King by the rule of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> law. Truely I know, he was an Empereſſe childe, but no Queene of Englandes childe. For although Maude the Empereſſe his mother had a right and a good title to the Croune, and to be Queene of England, yet was ſhe neuer in poſſeſsion, but kepte from the poſſeſsion by King Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen. And therefore King Henry the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond can not iuſtly be ſaied, to be a Queene of Englandes childe, nor yet any Kinges childe, vnleſſe ye would intend the Kinges children by the wordes of <hi>Infantes de Roy &amp;c.</hi> to be children of farther degree, and deſcended from the right line of the King: ſo ye might ſay truely, that he was the child of King Henry the firſt, being in deede the ſonne and heire of Maude the Empereſſe,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7067:67"/>daughter and heire of Kinge Henrie the firſt. Whereby your ſaide rule is here fowly foiled.

That he was borne out of the Realme, it is very true: but that he was reiected fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Croune for that cauſe, it is very falſe. Neither haue you any auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to proue your vaine opinion in this pointe.

                  <p>Thus may ye ſee, gentle Reader, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this pretenſed Maxime of the lawe ſet forth by th'Aduerſaries, nor a great nomber more, as general as this is (whiche before I haue ſhewed) can by any reaſonable meanes be ſtretched, to bind the Croune of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. Theſe reaſons and authorities may for this time ſuffice, to proue, that the Croune of this Realme is not ſubiecte to the rules and the Principles of the common lawe, neither can be ruled and tried by the ſame. Whiche thing being true, al the obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries made againſt the title of Marie the Queene of Scotland to the ſucceſsion of the Croune of this Realme, are fully anſwered, and thereby clearly wiped away.</p>
                  <p>Yet for farther arguments ſake, and to the ende we might haue al matters ſifted to the vttermoſt, and therby al things made plaine: let vs for this tyme ſomewhat yeelde vnto
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7067:68"/>the Aduerſaries, admitting, that the Title of the Croune of this Realme were to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and tried by the rules and principles of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon law, and then let vs conſider and examin farther, whether ther be any rule of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon law, or els any ſtatute, that by good and iuſt conſtruction can ſeeme to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne the ſaid title of Marie the Queene of Scotland, or no. For touching her lineal deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cente fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> King Henry the ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th, and by his eldeſt daughter (as we haue ſhewed) there is no man ſo impudent to denie. What is there then to be obiected among al the rules, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes, and iudgements of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon law of this Realm? Only one rule, as a general Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime, is obiected againſt her. And yet the ſame rule is ſo vntruely ſet forth, that I can not wel agree, that it is any rule or Maxime of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon law of this Realm of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. Your prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſed Maxime is, whoſoeuer is born out of the realm of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and of father and mother not being vnder the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the King of England, cannot be capable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herite any thing in England.
<note place="margin">A falſe Maxime ſet forth by the Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie.</note> Which rule is nothing true, but altogether falſe. For euery ſtranger and Alien is hable to purchace the inheritance of landes within this Realme, as

And although the ſame purchace is of ſome men accounted to be to the vſe of the King: yet vntil ſuch time as the king be intitled therevnto by matter of Record, the inheritance remaineth in the Alien by the opinion of al men. And ſo is a very Alien capable of inheritance within this Realme. And then it muſt nedes fal out very plainly, that your general Maxime, where vpon you haue talked and bragged ſo muche, is now become no rule of the common law of this Realme. And if it be ſo: then haue you vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered very many wordes to ſmal purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>But yet let vs ſee fartther, whether there be any rule or Maxime in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Law, that may ſeeme any thing like to that rule, wherevppon any matter may be gathered againſt the Title of the ſaid Marie Queene of Scotland.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Lawe, in wordes ſomewhat like vnto that, whiche hath ben alleaged by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries. Which rule is ſet forth and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a ſtatute made anno 25. of King Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the third. Which ſtatute reciting the doubt that then was, whether infants borne
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7067:69"/>out of the allegeance of England, ſhould be hable to demaund any heritage within the ſame allegeance, or no: it was by the ſame ſtatute ordeined, that al infantes inheritours, which after that time ſhould be borne out of the allegeance of the King, whoſe father and mother at the time of their birth, were of the feaith and allegea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, ſhould haue and enioy the ſame bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fittes and aduantages, to haue and carie he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage within the ſaid allegeance, as other heires ſhould. Whervpon it is to be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by dew and iuſt conſtruction of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, and hath bene heretofore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon law alwaies was, and yet is, that no perſon borne out of the alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the King of England, whoſe father and mother were not of the ſame allegea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, ſhould be able to haue or demaund any he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage within the ſame allegeance, as heire to any perſon. Which rule I take to be the ſame ſuppoſed Maxime, which the Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do meane. But to ſtretch it generally to al inheritances (as the Aduerſaries woulde ſeeme to do) by any reaſonable meanes can not be.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7067:70"/>conſequent.
<note place="margin">Scotland is vvithin the allegeance of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</note> That the Queene of Scotland was borne in Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, it muſt nedes be grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but that Scotland is out of the allegea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, though the ſaid Quene and al her ſubiects of Scotland, wil ſtourly affirme the ſame: yet ther is a great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of men in Eng<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/> and, both lerned and others, that be not of that opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being lead and perſuaded therto by diuers hiſtories, Regiſters, Recordes and Inſtruments of Homage, remaining in the treaſurie of this Realm, wherin is metioned, that the Kings of Scotland haue acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the King of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to be the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Lord ouer the Realme of Scotland, and haue done homage and fealtie for the ſame. Which thing being true (notwithſtanding it be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly denied by al Scotſmen) then by the lawes of this realme Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d muſt nedes be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted to be within the allegeance of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. And although ſins the time of King Henry the ſixt, none of the Kinges of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande haue done the ſaid ſeruice vnto the Kinges of England: yet that is no reaſon in our lawe, to ſay, that therefore the Realme of Scotland at the time of the birth of the ſaid Ladie Marie Queene of Scotlande, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the thirtie and fourth yeare of the
<pb facs="tcp:7067:71"/>raigne of our late Souereigne Lorde King Henrie the eight, was out of the allegeance of the kinges of England.
<note place="margin">The Lorde loſeth not his ſeigno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, though the tena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te doth not his ſeruice</note> For the law of this Realm is very plain, that though the Tenant do not his ſeruice vnto the Lorde, yet hath not the Lord thereby loſt his Seignorie. For the lande ſtill remaineth within his Fee and Seignorie, that notwithſtanding.</p>
                  <p>But peraduenture ſome wil obiecte and ſay, that by that reaſon France ſhould like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be ſaid to be within the allegeance of England: foraſmuch as the poſſeſsion of the Croune of France hath bene within a litle more then the ſpace of one hundred yeares now laſt paſt, laufully veſted in the kinges of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, whoſe right and title ſtil remaineth.</p>
                  <p>To that obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it may be anſwered, that there is a great difference betwene the right and title, which the Kings of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d claime to the Realme of Fraunce, and the right and title which they claime to the Realme of Scotlande. Although it be true, that the Kinges of Englande haue bene lawfully poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the Croune of France: yet during ſuch time, as they by vſurpation of others are diſpoſſeſſed of the ſaide Realme of France, the ſame Realme by no meanes can
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7067:71"/>be ſaid to be within their allegeance: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering, how that ſyns the time of vſurpation, the people of France haue who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forſaken their allegeance and ſubiection, which they did owe vnto the Kings of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, and haue geuen and ſubmitted them ſelues vnder the obedience and allegeance of the vſurpers. But as for the Realme of Scotlande, it is otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>For the Title, whiche the Kinges of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland haue claimed vnto the Realme of Scotland, is not in the poſſeſsion of the lande and Croune of Scotlande: but onely vnto the ſeruice of homage and fealtie for the ſame. And although the Kinges of Scotland, ſith the time of King Henry the eight, haue intermitted to doe the ſaid homage and feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vnto the Kinges of Englande: yet for al that the Kinges of Scotland can not by any reaſon or lawe be called vſurpers.</p>
                  <p>And thus may ye ſee, gentle Reader, by the opinion of al indifferente men, not lead by affection, that the Realme of Scotlande hath bene, and is yet within the allegeance and dominion of England. And ſo is the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent or firſt propoſition falſe. And yet that maketh no proufe, that the Realme of
<pb facs="tcp:7067:72"/>France likewiſe ſhould nowe be ſaid to be within the allegeance of the Kings of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, by reaſon of the manifeſt and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent difference before ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>But what if your Antecedent were true, and that we did agree both with the ſaid Queene of Scotland and her ſubiectes, and alſo with you, that Scotland were out of the allegeance of England? Yet it is very plaine, that your conſequent and concluſion can not by any meanes be true.
<note place="margin">The cauſes vvhy the Croune ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed vvithin the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Maxime.</note> And that princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally for three cauſes, whereof one is, for that neither the King, not the Croune (not being ſpecially me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned in the ſaid rule or pretended Maxime) can be intended to be within the meaning of the ſame Maxime, as we haue before ſufficiently proued by a great number of other ſuche like generall rules and Maximes of the lawes. An other cauſe is, for that the Croune can not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be within the woordes of the ſaid ſuppoſed Maxime: and that for twoo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectes: one is, bycauſe the rule doth only diſhable Aliens to demaunde any heritage within the allegeance of England. Whiche rule can not be ſtretched to the demaunde of the Croune of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, which is not with
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7067:72"/>in the allegeance of England: but is the very allegeance it ſelfe. As for a like example: it is true, that al the landes within the Kinges dominion are holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the King, either me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly, or immediately: and yet it is not true, that the Croune (by whiche onely the King hath his Dominion) can be ſaid to be holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the King.
<note place="margin">Without the croune there can neither be King nor allegeance</note> For without the Croune there can be neither King, nor allegeance. And ſo long as the Croune reſteth onely in demaund, not being veſted in any perſon, ther is no allegea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce at al. So that the Croune can not be ſaid by any meanes to be within the allegeance of England: and therfore not within the wordes of the ſaid rule or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime. The Title of the Croune is alſo out of the wordes and meaning of the ſame rule in an other reſpect: and that is, bycanſe that rule doth only diſhable an Alien to demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d landes by deſcent as heire. For it doth not extende vnto landes purchaſed by an Alien, as we haue before ſufficiently proued. And then can not that rule extende vnto the Croune being a thing incorporate, the right wherof doth not deſcend according to the common courſe of priuate inheritance, but goeth by ſucceſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as other corporatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s do.</p>

And although the Croune hath alwaies gone ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common courſe of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent: yet doth it not properly deſcende, but ſuccede. And that is the reaſon of the lawe, that although the Kinge be more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured in all his doinges, then any common perſon ſhalbe: yet can not the King by lawe auoide his grauntes and Letters Patentes by reaſon of his Nonage, as other infantes may doe, but ſhal alwaies be ſaid to be of ful age in reſpect of his Croune: euen as a Perſon, Vicare or Deane, or any other perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate ſhalbe. Whiche can not by any meanes be ſaid in lawe, to be within age in reſpect of their corporations, although the corporation be but one yeare olde.</p>
                  <p>Byſides that, the King can not by the law
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7067:73"/>auoide the Letters Patentes made by any v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper of the Croune (vnleſſe it be by act of Parlament) no more then other perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate ſhal auoide the grauntes made by one that was before wrongfully in their places and romes:
<note place="margin">The King is alvvaies at ful age in reſpecte of his Croune.</note> whereas in Deſcentes of inheritance the lawe is otherwiſe. For there the heire may auoide al eſtates made by the diſſeafour, or abatour, or any other perſon, whoſe eſtate is by lawe defeated. Whereby it doth plainely appeare, that the King is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate vnto the Croune, and hath the ſame properly by ſucceſsion, and not by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent onely. And that is likewiſe an other reaſon, to proue, that the King and the Croune can neither be ſaide to be within the wordes, nor yet with in the meaning of the ſaid general rule or Maxime.</p>
                  <p>The third and moſt prncipall cauſe of all is, for that in the ſaid ſtatute, whervpon the ſaid ſuppoſed rule or Maxime is gathered, the children deſcendantes and deſcended of the blood royal by the wordes of <hi>Infantes de Roy</hi> are expreſly excepted out of the ſaid ſuppoſed rule or Maxime.

Whiche although we might very wel admit and allow: yet can it not be denied, but that the ſame priuilege was grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted vnto the Kinges children and other deſcendantes of the Blood roial, by reaſon of the dignity and worthines of the Croune, which the King their father did enioy, and the great reuerence, which the law geueth of dewtie therevnto. And therefore if ye would go about, to reſtraine and withdraw from the Croune that priuilege, whiche the lawe geueth to the Kinges children for the Crounes ſake: ye ſhould doo therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to al reaſon, and againſt the rules of the Arte of Reaſoning, which ſaith, that: <hi>Propter quod vnumquodque, &amp; illud magis.</hi>

The pitiful reigne of the ſaid Iohn who doth not lament, with the lamentable loſſe of Normandie, Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and the poſsibilitie of the Dukedome of Britanie, and with the loſſe of our other goodly poſſeſsions in France, whereof the Croune of England was robbed and ſpoiled by the vnlawful vſurping of him againſt his nephew Arthur.

<pb facs="tcp:7067:83"/>a one, as wrote the Actes of the time by the inſtruction of the King him ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>I ſay then, the worthy wiſe Salomon fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing, that ſuch deuolution might happen, was an interpretour with his prudente and ſage Counſaile for our cauſe. For els, they neaded not to reaſon of any ſuch ſubiection to Scotlande, if the children of the Ladie Margaret might not lawfully inherite the Croune of England. For, as to her huſband we could not be ſubiect, hauing him ſelfe no right by this mariage to the Title of the Croune of this Realme. Wherevpon I may wel inferre, that the ſaid newe Maxime of theſe men (whereby they would rule and ouer rule the ſucceſsion of Princes) was not knowen to the ſaid wiſe King, neither to any of his Counſaile: Or if it were, yet was it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken not to reache to his blood royall borne in Scotlande. And ſo on euery ſide the Title of Quene Marie is aſſured. So that now by this that we haue ſaid, it may eaſely be ſeen, by what light and ſlender conſideration the Aduerſarie hath gone about to ſtrayne the wordes <hi>Infantes</hi> or children to the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree only. Of the like weight is his other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration, imagini<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g and ſurmiſing, this ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7067:83"/>to be made, bicauſe the King had ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to be ſo oft ouer the ſea with his ſpouſe the Queene. As though diuers Kings before him vſed not often to paſſe ouer the ſeas. As though this were a perſonal ſtatute made of ſpecial purpoſe, and not to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon law. Which to ſay, is moſt directly repugnant and contrary to the letter of the ſaid ſtatute. Or as though his children alſo did not very often repaire to outward Countries:
<note place="margin">The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of King E. 3. ſonnes.</note> as Iohn of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaſter, that maried Peters the King of Caſtiles eldeſt daughter, by whoſe right he claimed the Croune of Caſtile: as his brother Edmu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Erle of Cambridge, that maried the yongeſt daughter: as Lionell Duke of Claraunce, that maried at Milaine Viola<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t daughter and heir to Galeatius Duke of Milan: But eſpecially Prince Edwarde, whiche moſte victoriouſly toke in battaile Iohn the French King, and brought him into England his priſoner, to the great triumphe and reioyſing of the Realme, whoſe eldeſt ſonne Edward that died in ſhort time after, was borne beyond the ſeas in Gaſcome, and his other ſonne Richard, that ſucceded his grandfather, was borne at Burdeaux, as theſe
<pb facs="tcp:7067:84"/>noble King Edwardes ſonnes maried with forainers: ſo did they geue out their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in mariage to foraine Princes, as the Duke of Lancaſter, his daughter Philippe to the king of Portingale, and his daughter Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therin to the King of Spaine, and his Neece Iohan, daughter to his ſonne Earle of Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, was ioyned in mariage to the King of Scottes: Iohan, daughter to his brother Thomas of Wodſtocke Duke of Glouceſter was Queene of Spaine, and his other daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Marie, Ducheſſe of Britannie.</p>
                  <p>Now by this mans interpretation, none of the iſſue of al theſe noble Women could haue enioyed the Croune of England, when it had fallen to them (though they had bene of the neereſt roial blood) after the death of their Aunceſtours. Which ſurely had bene againſt the auncient preſidentes and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that we haue declared, and againſt the common Lawe (the whiche muſte not be thought by this Statute any thing taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but only declared) and againſt al good reaſon alſo. For as we would haue thought this Realme greatly iniured, if it had ben de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded of Spaine or any of the foreſaid cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treies, being deuolued to the ſame by the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7067:84"/>foreſaid Mariages, as we thincke our ſelf at this day iniured, for the withholding of France: ſo the iſſue of the foreſaide noble wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might and would haue thought them hardly and iniuriouſly handled, yf any ſuch caſe had happened. Neither ſuche friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous interpretation and gloſes, as this man nowe frameth, and maketh vppon the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, woulde then haue ſerued, nor nowe wil ſerue.</p>
                  <p>But of all other his friuolous and foliſh gheſsing vpon the clauſe of the ſtatute for <hi>Infantes de Roy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A fond imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Aduerſarie of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 25. E. 3.</note> there is one moſt fond of al. For he would make vs beleue, ſuch is the mans ſkil, that this ſtatute touching <hi>Infantes de Roy</hi> was made for the great doubte more in them, then in other perſonnes, touching their inheritance to their Aunceſtours. For being then a Maxime (ſaieth he) in the lawe, that none could inherite to his Aunceſtours being not of father and mother vnder the obedience of the King: ſeing the King him ſelfe could not be vnder obedience: it plainely ſeemed, that the Kinges children were of farre worſe condition, then others, and quite excluded. And therefore he ſaith, that this ſtatute was not to geue them any
<pb facs="tcp:7067:85"/>other priuilege, but to make them equall with other. And that therefore this ſtatute, touching the Kinges children, is rather in the ſuperficial parte of the worde, then in effecte.</p>
                  <p>Nowe among other thinges he ſaieth (as we haue ſhewed before) that this word <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantes de Roy</hi> in this ſtatute mentioned, muſt be taken for the children of the firſt degree, whiche he ſeemeth to proue by a note taken out of M.
<note place="margin">There vvas no doubt made of the Kinges children borne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonde the ſeas.</note> Raſtal. But to this we anſwer, that this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſwetely dreamed, when he imagined this fonde and fantaſticall expoſition: And that he ſhewed him ſelfe a very infante in law and reaſon. For this was no Maxime, or at leſt not ſo certaine, before the making of this ſtatute, whiche geueth no new right to the Kinges children, nor anſwereth any doubt touching them, and their inheritance: but ſaith, that the law of the Croune of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland is, and alwaies hath bene, which lawe, ſaith the King, ſay the Lordes, ſay the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, we allowe and affirme for euer, that the Kinges children ſhalbe hable to inherite the Landes of their Aunceſters, where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Al the doubt was for other perſons, as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7067:85"/>appeareth euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly by the tenour of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, whether by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon law they being borne out of the allegeance, were heritable to their Aunceſtours. And it appeareth, that th' Aduerſary is driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the hard wal, when he is faine to catch hold vpon a ſelie poore marginal note of M. Raſtal, of the Kinges childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and not of the Kings childrens chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Which yet nothing at al ſerueth his purpoſe touching this ſtatute. But he, or the Printer, or who ſo euer he be, as he draweth out of the text many other notes of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>priſed: ſo vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, <hi>Les enfants de Roy,</hi> he noteth in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, <hi>The Kings childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> but how far that word reacheth, he ſaieth neither more, nor leſſe.</p>
                  <p>Neither it is any thing preiudicial to the ſaid Queenes right or Title, whether the ſaid wordes <hi>Infants,</hi> ought to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtrictly for the firſt degree, or farther enlarged. For if this ſtatute toucheth only the ſucceſsion of the Kings children to their Aunceſtours for other inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and not for the Cround, as moſt men take it, and as it may be (as we haue ſaid) very wel take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and allowed: then doth this ſuppoſed Maxime of forain borne, that ſeemeth to be gathered out of this ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,

                  <p>And theſe preſumptions are the more enforced, for that he had no cauſe, why he ſhould beare any affection either to the ſaid Queene of Scotland, or to the Lady Leneux and hauing withal no cauſe to be greaued or offended with his ſiſters the Frenche Queenes children, but to put the matter quite out of al ambiguitie and doubte, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth (they ſay) that there were eleuen witneſſes purpoſely called by the king, who were preſente at the ſigning of the ſaid Wil, and ſubſcribed their names to the ſame.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7067:91"/>ſort, as is pretended: I plainely denie. For being at the time of this pretenſed Wil fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and adorned with iſſue, the late king Edward, and the Ladies Marie, and Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth, their ſtate and ſucceſsion being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo lately by Acte of Parlament eſtabliſhed: what neede or likelyhod was there, for the king then to practiſe ſuch newe deuiſes, as neuer did, I ſuppoſe, any king in this Realme before, and fewe in any other byſide?

                  <p>What likelyhode was there, for him to practiſe ſuch deuiſes, eſpecially in his later daies (when wiſdome, the loue of God, and his Realme ſhould haue bene moſte ripe in him) that were likely to ſturre vppe a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fier of greeuouſe contention and woful deſtruction in England, then euer did the deadly factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the red Roſe and the white; lately by the incorporation and vnion of the houſe of Yorke and Lancaſter, in the perſon of his father through the mariage of Ladie Elizabeth eldeſt daughter of king Edwarde the fourth, moſt happily extinguiſhed and buried?

                  <p>And as he could not be ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t therof: ſo it is not to be thought, that he would abuſe the great confidence put vppon him by the Parlament, and diſherite without any appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent cauſe the next royal blood, and thinke all thinges ſure by the colour of Parlament. The litle force whereof againſt the right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritour, he had (to his fathers and his owne ſo ample benefit) ſo lately and ſo largely ſene and felt. And yet if he minded at any time, to preiudice the ſaid Lady Marie Queend of Scotland, of al times he would not haue done it then, when al his care was, by al poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible meanes to contriue and compaſſe a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, betwene his ſonne Edward, and the ſaid Lady and Quene. Surely he was to wiſe

                  <p>And leaſt of all can we ſay he attempted that diſhonorable diſheriſion for any ſpecial inclination or fauour he bare to the French Queene his ſiſters children. For there haue bene of his neere and priuie Counfaile, that haue reported, that the King neuer had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great liking of the mariage of his ſiſter with the Duke of Suffolke, who maried her firſt priuily in France, and afterward openly in England. And as it is ſaid, had his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for the ſaid priuy mariage in writing. Howe ſo euer this matter goeth, certeine it is, that if this pretenſed Wil be true, he transferreed and tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpoſed the reuerſion of the Croune, not only from the Queene of Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, from my Ladie Leneux and their iſſue, but euen from my Ladie Francis, and my Ladie Elenour alſo, daughters to the Frenche Queene, whiche is a ching in a manner incredible, and therefore nothing likely.</p>
                  <p>I muſt now, gentle Reader, put thee in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of two other moſt pregna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and notable coniectures and preſumptions. For

And leaſt of al make ſuch aſsignation of the Croune, as is nowe pretended.</p>
                  <p>For being a Prince of ſuch wiſdome and experience, he could not be ignorant, that this was the next and redieſt way, to put the ſtate at leaſt of both his daughters to great peril and vtter diſheriſon.

And did not, I pray you, this drift and deuiſe fal out euen ſo, tending to the vtter excluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the late Queene Marie, and her Siſter Elizabeth: if God had not of his mercy, moſt gratiouſly and wonderfully repreſſed and ouerthrowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame?</p>
                  <p>Theſe reaſons then and preſumptions may ſeme wel able and ſufficient, to beare doune, to breake doune and ouerthrow the weake and ſlender preſumptions of th'Aduerſaries, grounded vpon vncertaine and mere ſurmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, gheſſes and coniectures: as among other that the King was offended with the Quene of Scotland, and with the Ladie Leneux. Which is not true. And as for the Ladie Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neux, it hath no manner of probabilitie: as it hath not in dede in the ſaid Queene. And if it had, yet it is as probable and much more probable, that the King would haue eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7067:94"/>at that time (for ſuch cauſe, as we haue declared) ſuppreſſed the ſame diſpleaſure. Graunting now, that there were ſome ſuch diſpleaſure: was it honorable, either for the King, or the Realm, or was it, thinke ye, euer thought by the Parlament, that the King ſhould diſherite them for euery light diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure?

                  <p>Againe, if he had made any ſuch aſsigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: who doubteth, but that as he condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the ſaid pretenſed Wil with his noble daughters, to marie with his Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſels
<pb facs="tcp:7067:96"/>aduiſe,
<note place="margin">In this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed vvil is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the heires of the L.

                  <p>Farthermore, I am driuen to thinke, that ther paſſed no ſuch limitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the ſaid king Henries wil, by reaſon there is not, nor was theſe many yeares any original copy therof, nor any authe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tical Record in the Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerie, or els wher to be ſhewed in al Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, as the Aduerſaries the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues confeſſe, and in the co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pies that be ſpread abrode, the witneſſes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to be preſent at the ſigning of the ſaid Wil, be ſuch for the meaneſſe of their ſtate on the one ſide, and for the greatneſſe and weight of the cauſe on th'other ſide, as ſeme not the moſt ſufficient for ſuche a caſe.</p>
                  <p>The importance of the cauſe, being no leſſe then the diſheriſion of ſo many heires of the Croune (as wel from the one ſiſter, as fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other) required and craued ſome one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the priuie Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſaile, or ſome one ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable and notable perſon to haue ben pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the ſaid ſigning, or that ſome notifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould haue ben made afterward to ſuch perſons by the King him ſelfe, or at leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome Notarie and authe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tical perſon for
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7067:96"/>the better ſtrengthening of the ſaid Wil.</p>
                  <p>Here is now farther to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered, that ſeing the intereſt to the Croune is become a plaine teſtamentarie matter and claime, and dependeth vpon a laſt Wil: when, and before what Ordinarie this Wil was exhibited, al lowed and prooued? Where, and of whome toke the Executours their othe for the true performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Wil?
<note place="margin">No order taken for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of the ſuppoſed vvil.</note> Who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> th'adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Kings goods and chattles? When, and to whome haue they brought in the Inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tory of the ſame? Who examined the witneſſes vpon their othe, for the tenour and trueth of the ſaid Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? Namely vpon the ſignement of the Kinges hand, wherein only conſiſteth the weight of no leſſe, then of the Croune it ſelf: where, or in what ſpiritual or temporal Courte may one find their depoſitions? But it were a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard thing, to finde that, that (as farre as men can learne) neuer was.</p>
                  <p>And yet if the matter were ſo plaine, ſo good and ſo ſound, as theſe men beare vs in hand, if the original Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t had ben ſuch, as might haue bidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the touchſtone, the trial the light and the ſight of the worlde: why did not they, that enioyed moſt commoditie
<pb facs="tcp:7067:97"/>therby (and, for the ſway and authorite they bare, might and ought beſt to haue done it) take co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient and ſure order, that th'origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal might hane ben duely and ſafely preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or at the leaſt the ordinarie Probate, which is in euery poore mans Teſtament di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly obſerued, might haue ben procured or ſene, one or other aute<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tical Inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t therof reſerued? The Aduerſaries the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſee wel inough, yea and are faine to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes. But to helpe this miſchief, they wold fame haue the Enrolme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the Chancerie to be taken for a ſufficient Probate,
<note place="margin">The enrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement in the chance rie is not a probate.</note> by cauſe (as they ſay) both the ſpiritual and temporal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie did concurre in the Kings perſon.</p>
                  <p>Yet do they know wel inough, that this plaiſter wil not cure the ſore, and that this is but a poore helpe and a ſhift. For neither the Letters Patents, nor th'Enrolme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t may in any wiſe be counted a ſufficient Probate. The Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerie is not the Court or ordinarie place for the probate of Willes, nor the Rolles for recording the ſame. Both muſt be done in the Spiritual Courts, where th'Executours alſo muſt be impleaded, and geue their accompt, where the weakenes or ſtrength of the Wil muſt be tried, the witneſſes examined, finally
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7067:97"/>the probate, and al other thinges thereto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, diſpatched. Or if it may be done by any other perſon: yet muſt his authoritie be ſhewed. The probate and al thinges muſt be done accordingly. And among other things the vſual clauſe of <hi>Saluo iure cuiuſcun<expan>

                        </expan>,</hi> muſt not be omitted. Which things, I am aſſured, the recording in the Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerie ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not import.</p>
                  <p>But this caution and prouiſo of <hi>Saluo iure cuiuſcunque</hi> (which is moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formable to al law and reaſon) did litle ſerue ſome mens turne. And therefore there was one other caution and prouiſo: that though the pooreſt mans Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in al England hath this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſo at the probate of the ſame: yet for this Teſtament, the weightieſt, I trow, that euer was made in England no ſuche probate or clauſe can be found, either in the one, or the other Court. Yet we nedes muſt, al this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, be borne in hande, and borne doune, that there was a Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and Wil, formably framed, according to the purpoſe and effect of the ſtatute, yet muſt the right of th'imperial Croune of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueied and caried away with the color and ſhadow only of a Wil. I ſay, the ſhadow only, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of another coniecture and preſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb facs="tcp:7067:98"/>whiche I ſhal tel you of. Whiche is ſo liuely and effectual, that I verily ſuppoſe, it wil be very harde for any man, by any good and probable reaſon, to anſwere and auoide the ſame. And is ſo important and veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that this only might ſeeme, vtterly to deſtroie al the Aduerſaries coniectural prouffes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the maintenance of this ſuppoſed Wil.</p>
                  <p>We ſay therfore and affirme, that in caſe there had ben any good and ſure helpe and handfaſt, to take and hold the Croune for the heirs of Lady Francis by the ſaid Wil: that the faction, that vniuſtly intruded the Lady Iane, eldeſt daughter to the ſaid Lady Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cis to the poſſeſsion of the Croune, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue omitted to take, receaue and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and benefit therof to them preſently offered. They neither would, nor could haue ben driuen, to ſo harde and bare a ſhifte, as to colour their vſurpation againſt the Late Queene Marie only, and her Siſter Elizabeth, with the Letters Patents of King Edward the ſixt, and with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of ſuch as they had procured.
<note place="margin">A great preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſuppoſed vvil, for that the late pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſed Q.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7067:98"/>it. It was neede for them, I ſay, as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured ſuche Letters Patentes, ſo to haue ſet forth alſo the ſaid pretenſed Wil, if ther had ben then any ſuch Wil in deede ſufficiently and dewly to be proued, as is now ſurmiſed there was. The Recorde of the ſaid ſurmiſed Wil was in the Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerie, which they might haue vſed with the pretenſed witneſſes, and with the original prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſed Wil, and with al other things therto belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging to their beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage. It can not be thought, that either they were ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of it, or that they would forbeare and forgoe ſo greate a commoditie offered, and ſuch a plauſible pretext of their prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſed vſurpatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, bearing the contenance and authoritie of the Kings Wil, and of the whole Parlament, for the excluſion of the Quene of Scotland and others of the nerer royal blood. Neither can it be ſaid, that the Letters Patentes were made, as it were for a ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger corroboratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only of the ſaid pretenſed Wil:

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed proclamation for the ſuppoſed right of the ſaid Lady Iane, by the force of that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Wil: whereby it might any thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that king Henry the eight made any
<pb facs="tcp:7067:99"/>manner of limitation or aſsignation of the Croune to the heires of the Lady Francis. Wherevpon it may wel be gathered, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they knew of no ſuche limitation to the children of the Lady Francis by the ſaid ſuppoſed Wil, or toke it to be ſuch, as could geue no good and lawful force and ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, to ayde and mainteine their vſurpation for the manifeſt forgerie of the ſame. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they purpoſely (for, ignorance can not be pretended in them) kepte backe and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the ſaid Letters Patentes this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſed limitation ſurmiſed to be made for the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſaid Lady Francis. Which neuertheleſſe the Aduerſaries do now with ſo great and vehement aſſeueration blowe into al mens cares. which is vtterly reiected and ouerthrowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and it were by nothing els but by this Proclamation for the pretenſed Title of the ſaid Lady Iane.

                  <p>But yet in eaſe any man do loke for any other, and more perſuaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and proufe, which as I ſaid, neede not: ô the great prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God, ô his great fauour and goodnes to this Realme, of the which it hath bene ſaid: <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnum

                  <p>As for the eleuen witneſſes, the beſte of of them Sir Iohn Gates, we know, by what meanes he is departed out of this life. One
<pb facs="tcp:7067:102"/>other, the ſaid William Clarke is ſo gone from them, that he geueth good cauſe, to miſdeeme and miſtruſt the whole matter. Howe many of the reſidue liue, I know not. To whom perchaunce ſome thing might be ſaid, if we once knowe, what them ſelues ſay. Which ſeeing it doth not by authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal recorde appeare, bare names of dumme witneſſes can in no wiſe hinder and deface ſo ſolemne a teſtimonie of the foreſaid L. Paget and Sir Edwarde Mountague. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the difficultie ſo great, as the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries pretend, in prouing <hi>Negatiuam fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hovv a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue may be proued.</note> Which as we graunt it to be true, when it ſtandeth within the limites of a mere ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue: ſo being reſtrained and referred to time and place, may be as wel proued, as the affirmatiue.
<note place="margin">Gloſſ. &amp; Doct. c. bo na de elect</note> It appeareth now then by the premiſses, that the Aduerſaries argumentes, whereby they would weaken and diſcredit the teſtimonie, either of the witneſſes, or of the executours, that haue or may come in againſt the ſaid pretenſed Wil, are but of ſmal force and ſtrength. And eſpecially their ſlender exaggeration by a ſuperficial Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torike enforced. Whereby they would ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vſe the ignorance of the people, and make
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7067:102"/>them beleue, that there was no good and ſubſtantial prouffe brought foorth againſt the forgerie of this ſuppoſed Wil, by cauſe the vntrueth of the ſame was not preached at Poules Croſſe, and declared in al open places and aſſembles through the Realme: when they knowe wel inough, that there was no neceſsitie ſo to doe. And that it was notoriouſly knowen, by reaſon it was diſcloſed by the ſaide Lorde Paget, as wel to the Counſaile, as to the higher and lower houſe of the Parlament. And the foreſaid forged Recorde in the Chancerie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon worthely defaced, and aboliſhed. The diſcloſing whereof ſeing it came foorth by ſuch, and in ſuch ſort and order, as we haue ſpecified: as it doth nothing deface or ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh the teſtimonie geuen againſt the ſaid ſuppoſed Wil,
<note place="margin">Hovv and vvhen the later teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie is to be acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the former.</note> whether it were of any of the witneſſes, or executours: ſo is ther no nede at al, why any other witneſſes, byſides thoſe that haue already impugned the ſame, ſhould be now farther producted.</p>
                  <p>I denie not, but that if any ſuch witneſſe or Exeoutour had vpon his othe before a lawful Iudge, depoſed of his owne certaine notice and knoweledge, that the ſaid Wil
<pb facs="tcp:7067:103"/>was ſigned with the Kinges owne hande: in caſe he ſhould afterward contrarie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke this his ſolemne depoſition, it ought not lightly to be diſcredited for any ſuche contradiction afterward happening. But, as I haue ſaid, ſuche authentical and ordinarie examinations and depoſitions we find not, nor yet heare of any ſuch ſo paſſed. Now contrariwiſe if any of the ſaid witneſſes or executours haue or ſhal before a compete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Iudge, eſpecially not producted of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or againſt any partie for any priuate ſuite commenced, but, as I haue ſaid, moued of conſcience only, and of a zeale to truth, and to the honour of God and the Realme, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and voluntarie diſcouer and detecte ſuch forgerie (although perchance it toucheth them ſelues for ſome thing done or ſaid of them to the contrary, or being called by the ſaid co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>petent Iudge, haue or ſhal declare and teſtifie any thing againſt the ſame) this later teſtimonie may be wel credited by good reaſon and law.</p>
                  <p>Whereas they would nowe inferre, that either this pretenfed Will was King Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Wil, or that he made none at al: I doo not (as I haue ſaid) entende, nor neede not
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7067:103"/>curiouſly to examine and diſcuſſe this thing as a mater not apperteining to our principal purpoſe. And wel it may be, that he made a Wil conteining the whole tenour of this pretenſed Wil (ſauing for the limitation of the Croune) and that theſe ſuppoſed wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes were preſent, either when he ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the ſame with his owne hand, or when by his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundment the Stampe (of which and of his owne hand, the common ſort of men make no difference, as in dede in diuers other caſes there is no difference, whiche theſe witneſſes might take to be as it were his owne hand) was ſet to the Wil.</p>
                  <p>This, I ſay, might after ſome ſort ſo be. And yet this notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding there might be (as there was in deede) an other Wil tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſed limitation of the Croune by the Kinges owne hande counterfeyted and ſuborned after his death falſly and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorably, bearing the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance of his owne hand, and of the pretenſed witneſſes names. How ſo euer it be, it is but to ſmal purpoſe, to goe about any full and exquiſite anſwere touching this point, ſeeing that neither the original ſurmiſed Wil, whereof theſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are ſuppoſed to be priuy, is extant, nor
<pb facs="tcp:7067:104"/>their depoſitions any where appeare, nor yet that it appeareth, that euer they were (as we haue ſaid) iudicially examined.</p>
                  <p>Seeing nowe then, that if it ſo falleth out, that the principal Wil, and that that was by the great Seale exemplified, and in the Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery recorded, had not (at leaſt touching the clauſe of limitation and aſsignment of the Croune) the Kings hand to it: we neede not nor wil not tarie about certain ſcrolles and copies of the ſaid Wil, that the Aduerſaries pretend to haue ben either writte, or ſigned with his hand. A kingdom is to heauy to be ſo eaſely caried away by ſuche ſcrolles and copies. When al this faileth, the Aduerſaries haue yet one ſhift left for the laſt caſt. They vrge the equitie of the matter and the mind of the Parlament. Which is, they ſay, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed and ſatisfied, by making this aſsigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the eſtabliſhing of the ſucceſsion, and prouiding, that the Realme ſhould not be left void of a Gouernour. And therefore we muſt not ſubuert the ſtatute, in cauilling for the defect of the Kings hand: foraſmuch as the Parlament might haue had authoriſed his conſent only, without any hand writing. Which as I doe not denie, ſo in theſe great
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7067:104"/>affaires and ſo ample a commiſsion, in ſuche abſolute authoritie geuen to him, it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently and neceſſarily foreſene, to binde the Acte to the Kings owne hand, for auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding al ſiniſter and euil dealing, the whiche the Aduerſaries would haue vs in no caſe to miſdoubt or miſtruſt in this Wil. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the notoriouſnes of the fact, and the lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table euent of things do openly declare the ſame, and pitifully crieth out againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Neither wil we graunt to them, that the minde and purpoſe of the Parlament is ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, for ſuch cauſes, as we haue and ſhall hereafter more largely declare. And if it were otherwiſe true, yet doth this only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the Kinges hand breake and infringe the whole Acte.
<note place="margin">Why the ſtampe ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teruaile the Kings hand in this caſe.</note> For this is a ſtatute corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie, and derogatorie to the common courſe of the Lawe, as cutting away the ſucceſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the lawful and true inheritours.

And ſo withal do we conclude, that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon this ſurmiſed Wil was not ſigned with the Kinges hand: it can not any way hurt or hinder the iuſte right and claime of the Quene of Scotland, to the ſucceſsion of the Croune of England.</p>
                  <p>Now ſuppoſing, that neither the L.

She hath her iuſt defence and exceptions, and muſt haue. And it were againſt al lawes, and the lawe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe, to ſpoile her of the ſame.

But for the qualification of the perſon to be limited and aſsigned, and ſo for the neceſſarie reſtriction and limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wordes, were they neuer ſo large and ample: there is (though nothing were ſpoken thereof) an ordinary helpe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie. Otherwiſe, if the Realme had ben ſet ouer to a furious or a madde man, or to an idiote,

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7067:109"/>the good minde and purpoſe of the Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and mans reaſon doe in no wiſe beare it. If ye graunt, that theſe wordes muſt nedes haue ſome good and honeſt conſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and interpretation, as reaſon doth force you to graunt it: yet wil I aſke farther, whether as the King cutte of in this pretenſed Wil the whole noble race of the eldeſt ſiſter, and the firſt iſſue of the yongeſt ſiſter: ſo if he had cutte of alſo al the ofſpringes as wel of the ſaid yongeſt ſiſter, as of the remnante of the royal blood, and placed ſome, being not of the ſaid blood, and perchance otherwiſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: this aſsignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had bene good and vail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in law, as conformable to reaſon, and to the mind and purpoſe of the Parlament?

                  <p>
                     <hi>For if it be a newe Wil then deuiſed, who could thinke, that either him ſelfe would, or any man durſt haue moued him, to put therin ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinges contrary to his honour?

For it is certaine, that not only the common lawe of this Realme, but nature it ſelfe telleth vs, that the Queene of Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d (after the ſaid Kinges children) is the next and rightful Heire of the Croune. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King, if he had excluded her, he had done an vnnatural acte.

                        </gap>ium</hi> doth require and craue, that as the Kings of this Realme would thinke them ſelues to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuriouſly handled and openly wronged, if they mariyng with the heires of Spaine, Scotland or any other Countrey (where the ſucceſsion of the Croune deuolueth to the woman) were ſhutte out, and barred from
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7067:112"/>theyr ſaid right dewe to them by the wiues (as we haue ſaid): ſo likewiſe they ought to thinke of women of their royal blood, that marie in Scotland, that they may wel iudge and take them ſelues much iniured, vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and wrongfully dealt withall, to be thruſte from the ſucceſsion of this Croune, being thereto called by the nexte proximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the royal blood. And ſuch deuolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of other Kingdoms to the Croune of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land by foraine mariage, might by poſsibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie often times haue chaunced, and was euen nowe in this our time very like to haue chanced for Scotland, if the intended mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with the Queene of Scotland that now is, and the late King Edward the ſixt with his longer life, and ſome iſſue had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> place.</p>
                  <p>But now, that ſhe is no ſuche forainer, as is not capable of the Croune, we haue at large already diſcuſſed. Yea I wil now ſay farther, that ſuppoſing the Parlament minded, to exclude her, and might rightful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo doe, and that the King by vertue of this ſtatute did exclude her in his ſuppoſed Wil: yet is ſhe not a plaine forainer, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of the Croune. For if the lawfull heires of the ſaid Ladie Francis, and of the
<pb facs="tcp:7067:113"/>Ladie Elenour ſhould happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to faile (which ſeeme now to faile, at the leaſt in the Ladie Katherin and her iſſue, for whoſe title, great ſturre hath lately ben made, by reaſon of a late ſentence definitiue, geuen againſt her pretenſed mariage with the Earle of Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford) then is there no ſtay or ſtoppe, either by the Parlament, or by the ſuppoſed Will, but that ſhe the ſaid Queene of Scotlande, and her Heires, may haue and obteine their iuſt Title and claime. For by the ſaid pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſed Wil it is limited, that for default of the lawfull Heyres of the ſaid Ladre Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis and Elenour, the Croune ſhall remaine and come to the next rightful Heires.</p>
                  <p>But if ſhe ſhal be ſaid to be a forainer for the time, for the induction of farther ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: then what ſaye the Aduerſaries to my Ladie Leneux, borne at Herbot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel in England, and from thirtene yeares of age brought vppe alſo in England, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly taken and reputed as well of the King and Nobilitie, as of other, the lawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Neece of the ſaid King? Yea to turne nowe to the other Siſter of the King, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to Charles Brandon Duke of Suffolke, and her children, the Ladie Francis, and the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7067:113"/>Ladie Elenour: why are they alſo diſheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? Surely, if there be no iuſt cauſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Lady Leneux, nor in the other: it ſeemeth the King hath made a plaine Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiue of the Croune. Whiche thinge whether he could doe, or whether it be conformable to the expectation of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament, or for the Kinges honour, or for the honour for the Realme, I leaue it to the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſideration of other.</p>
                  <p>Nowe, what cauſes ſhould moue the Kinge, to ſhutte them out by his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Will from the Title of the Croune: I minde not, nor neede not (eſpecially ſeeing I take no notice of any ſuch Wil, touching the limitation of the ſaid Croune) here to to proſecute or examine.</p>
                  <p>Yet am I not ignorant, what impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes many doo talke of, and ſome as well by printed, as vnprinted Bookes, doe write of. Wherein I will not take vppon me any aſſeueration, any reſolution or iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement.</p>
                  <p>Thus only will I propound, as it were by the way of conſideration, duely and depely to be wayed and thought vpon: that is, for as muche as the benefitte of this

On th'other ſide, if ther were any ſuch impediment (whereof this ſurmiſed Wil geueth out a great ſuſpicion) it is to be conſidered, whether it ſtandeth with reaſon and iuſtice, with the honour of the King, and the whole Realme, or with the minde, purpoſe and intente of the ſaid Parlament, that the King ſhould not onely fruſtrate and exclude ſuche, whoſe right by the common lawe is moſte euidente and notoriouſe, but call and ſubſtitute ſuche other,

Againe, general wordes either of the Teſtatours, or of ſuche as make any contract, and eſpecially of ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, touching any perſons, to doe or enioy any thing, ought to be reſtrained and refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to hable, mete, and capable perſons only.</p>
                  <p>It is further more a rule and a Principle, that ſtatutes muſt be ruled, meaſured and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, according to the minde and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the general and common lawe. Wherefore the King in limiting the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion of the Croune in this ſorte, as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, ſeemeth not to anſwere and ſatisfie the expectation of the Parlament: putting the eaſe there were any ſuch ſurmiſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment, as alſo on the other ſide likewiſe, if there were no ſuch ſuppoſed impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</p>
                  <p>For here an other rule muſt be regarded: whiche is, that in Teſtaments, Contractes, and namely in ſtatutes, the generalitie of wordes muſt be gently and ciuilly modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and meaſured by the common law, and
<pb facs="tcp:7067:115"/>reſtrained,

                     </note> when ſo euer any man ſhould by that generalitie take any da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mage and hurte vndeſeruedly. Yea, the Statute ſhal rather in that caſe ceaſſe and quaile, and be taken as void. As for example, it appereth by the Ciuil law, that if it be enacted by ſtatute in ſome Cities, that noman ſhal pleade againſt an Inſtrument, no not the Executour: yet this notwithſtanding, if th'Executour make a true and perfect Inuentarie of the goodes of the Teſtatour, if he deale faithfully and truely, rather then he ſhould wrongfully and without cauſe paie the Teſtatours debt of his owne, he may come and pleade againſt the Inſtrument. Wherefore the Kinges doings ſeeme either muche defectiue in the ſaid Ladie Francis, and Ladie Elenour, or much exceſsiue in their children. And ſo though he had ſigned the ſaid Wil with his hand: yet the ſaid doings ſeme not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the mind and purpoſe of the Parlame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</p>
                  <p>We wil now go forward, and propound other great and graue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiderations ſeruing our ſaid purpoſe and intent. Whereof one is that in limiting the Croune vnto the heires of the bodie of the Ladie Francis, the ſame Ladie then, and ſo long after liuing, the ſaid
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7067:115"/>King did not appoint the Succeſsion of the Croune, according to th'order and meaning of the honourable Parlament: foraſmuch as the ſaid Acte of Parlament gaue to him au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, to limite and appoint the Croune to ſuch perſon, or perſons in reuerſion or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder, as ſhould pleaſe his Highnes. Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereby ſome perſon certaine, of whom the people might haue certaine knowledge and vnderſtanding, after the death of King Henrie the eight. Which perſons certaine the heires of the Ladie Francis could not by any meanes be intended:
<note place="margin">11. H. 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 72. 9. H. 6. <hi>fol.</hi> 24.11. H. 6. <hi>fol.</hi> 15.</note> foraſmuch as the ſaid Ladie Francis was then liuing, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could then haue no heires at al. By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wherof the people of this Realme could not haue certaine knowledge and perfit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Succeſsion, according to the true meaning and intent of the ſaid Acte of Parlament.</p>
                  <p>But to this matter ſome peraduenture would ſeeme to anſwere and ſay, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though at the time of the ſaid King Henries death, the Heires of the bodie of the ſaid Ladie Francis begotten, were vncertaine: yet at ſuche time, as the ſaid remainder ſhould happen to fal, the ſaid heires might
<pb facs="tcp:7067:116"/>then certainly be knowen. In deede I wil not deny, but that peraduenture they might be then certainly knowen. But what great miſchieffes and inconueniences might haue enſewed, and yet may, if the Wil take place vpon that peraduenture and vncertaine li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation: I would wiſhe all men well to note and conſider.</p>
                  <p>It is not to be doubted, but that it might haue fortuned, at ſuch time as the remainder ſhuld happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to fal to the ſaid heires of the La<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>die Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cis, the ſame Lady Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cis ſhould then be alſo liuing: who, I pray you, then ſhould haue had the Croune? Paradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture ye wold ſay, the heires of the body of the Ladie Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the next remainder was apoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Vndoubtedly that were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to the meaning of the ſaid ſuppoſed Wil: forſamuch as the remainder is therby limited vnto the heires of the body of the Ladie Elenour, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for default of iſſue of the Ladie Francis. Wherby it may be very plainly gathered vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſaid ſuppoſed Wil, that the meani<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was not, that the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Lady Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſhould enioye the Croune, before the children of the Lady Francis. But what if the ſaid Ladie Elenour had ben then alſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7067:116"/>(which might haue happened, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as both the ſaid Ladie Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cis and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die Elenour, by common courſe of nature, might haue liued longer, then vntil this day) who then ſhould haue had the Croune? Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the right Heyre (whome this ſuppoſed Wil meante to exclude) ſo long as there ſhould remaine any iſſue, either of the body of the ſaid Ladie Francis, or of the bodie of the ſaid Ladie Elenour lawfully begotten. And therefore quite contrarie to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſaid ſuppoſed Wil. Wherfore I doe verely thinke, that it would hardly ſinke into any reaſonable mans head, that had any experience of the great wiſdom and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed doings of King He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry the eight about other matters being of nothing like weight, that he would ſo ſlenderly and ſo vnaduifed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſe the ſucceſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the croune (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the whole eſtate of this Realme doth depend) in ſuche wiſe, that they, to whom he meant to geue the ſame, by his wil could not enioye it by the lawe. Wherevpon ye may plainely ſee, not only the great vnlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihod, that King He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry the eight would make any ſuch Wil with ſuch ſlender aduiſe, but alſo, that by the limitation of the ſaid Will,
<pb facs="tcp:7067:117"/>the ſucceſsion of the Croune is made more vncertaine and doubtful, then it was before the making of the ſaid Actes of Parlament. Which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the meaning and intent of the ſaid Actes, and therfore without any ſufficient warrant in law.</p>
                  <p>But peraduenture ſome here wil ſay, that although theſe dangers and vncertainties might haue enſewed vpon the limitation of the ſaid wil: yet forasmuch as they haue not happened, neither be like to happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they are therefore not to be ſpoken of. Yeas verely, it was not to be omitted. For although theſe things haue not happened, and therefore the more tolerable: yet forasmuch as they might haue happened, by the limitation of the ſaid ſuppoſed Wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the meaning of the ſaid Actes: the Wil can not by any meanes be ſaid to be made according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and intent of the makers of the ſaid ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes. And therefore in that reſpect the ſaid Wil is inſufficient in lawe. And to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate the matter farther, ye ſhal vnderſtand of great inconueniences and imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, which as yet are likely to enſue, if that ſuppoſed Wil ſhould take place.</p>
                  <p>It is not vnknowen, but that at the time
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7067:117"/>of the making of the ſaid Wil, the ſaid La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die Francis had no iſſue male, but onely three daughters betwene her, and Henrie Duke of Suffolke. Afterward in the time of our late ſoueraigne Ladie Queene Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, the ſaid Duke of Suffolke was attainted, and ſuffered accordingly. After whoſe death the ſaid Ladie Francis, to her great diſhonour and abaſing of her ſelfe, toke to huſbande one Adrian Stokes, who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her ſeruant, a man of very meane eſtate and vocation, and had iſſue by him. Which iſſue (if it were a ſon, and be alſo yet liuing) by the wordes of the ſaid ſuppoſed Wil, is to inherite the Croune of this Realme, before the daughters betwene her and the ſaid late Duke of Suffolke begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which thing was neither intended, nor meant by the makers of the ſaid Actes. Who can with any reaſon or common ſenſe thinke, that al the ſtates of the Realme aſſembled together at the ſaid Parlament, did meane, to geue authoritie to King Henry the eight, by his Letters Pate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts or laſt Wil to diſherit the Queene of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land lineally deſcended of the blood roial of this Realme, and to appoint the ſonne of Adrian Stokes, then a meane ſeruing man
<pb facs="tcp:7067:118"/>of the Duke of Suffolks, to be King and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour ouer this noble Realme of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. The inconueniences whereof, as alſo of the like that might haue followed of the prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Mariage of M. Keies the late Sergeante Porter, I referre to the graue conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and iudgementes of the honorable and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipful of this Realme.</p>
                  <p>Some peraduenture wil ſay, that King Henry the eight meant by his Wil, to diſpoſe the Croune vnto the Heires of the body of the ſaid Ladie Francis by the ſaid Duke law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully begotten, and not vnto the heires by any other perſon to be begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Which mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning although it might very hardly be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered vpon the ſaid ſuppoſed Wil: yet can not the ſame be without as great inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, as the other. For if the Croune ſhould nowe remaine vnto the heires of the bodie of the ſaid Ladie Francis by the ſaid Duke begotten: then ſhould it remaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two daughters ioyntly, they both being termed and certainly accompted in law but one heire. And by that meanes the ſtate and gouernment of this Realme ſhould be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the auncient Monarchie, into the gouernement of many. For the Title of the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7067:118"/>Ladie Francis being by way of remainder, whiche is compted in law a ioynt purchaſe, doth make all the iſſue female inheritable a like, and cannot go according to the ancient law of a deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the Croune: which is, that the Croune by deſcent muſt go to the eldeſt daughter only, as is aforeſaid. For great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces be in law, where one cometh to any Title by deſcent, and where, as a purchaſer. And alſo if th'one of thoſe iſſues female dye, then were her heire in the Title, as a ſeueral tenant in tayle. And ſo there ſhould follow, that ſo many daughters, ſo many general Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors, and ſo might their iſſue, being heirs females, make the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t grow infinite. Which thing was moſt farre from the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the makers of that Acte of Parlame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</p>
                  <p>What if the ſaid King had by his laſt Wil diſpoſed this realme into two or three parts, diuiding the gouernement thereof to three perſons, to rule as ſeueral Kinges: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Wales vnto one, the Northe partes vnto an other, the South partes vnto the third, and by that meanes had miſerably rent this Realme into partes? Had this ben accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the entent and meaning of the ſaid Acte of Parlament? Or had it bene a good
<pb facs="tcp:7067:119"/>and ſufficient limitation in law? No verily, I thinke no man of any reaſonable vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding wil ſo ſay. And no more can he either ſay, or thinke of the remainder limited vnto heires of the body of the ſaid Lady Francis by the ſaid ſuppoſed Wil.</p>
                  <p>Now to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plete and finiſh this our Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe touching the Queene of Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds Title to the fucceſsion of the Croune: as we haue done, ſo let vs freely and liberally graunt the Aduerſaries that, whiche is not true, that is, that the ſaid ſuppoſed Wil was ſigned with the Kings owne hand. Let the heires of the Lady Francis come forth in Gods name, and lay forth to the world their demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed right againſt the ſaid Q. of Scotlandes intereſt. The Quene on th'other ſide, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie and ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthen her claime, laieth forth to the open ſight of al the worlde her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uſt title and intereſt, ſigned, and alwaies afore this time allowed, not onely as with the Seales, but with the othes alſo of al the Kings, that euer wer in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the time of their Coronation, for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance of the lawes of this noble Realme of England, ſigned and allowed, I ſay, almoſt of al the world by ſides: yea ſigned with God and natures owne fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7067:119"/>Her right is as open, and as clere, as the bright Sonne. Now, to darken and ſhadow this glorious light: what doe the heires of the ſaid Ladie Francis, or others bring forth, to grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d their iuſt claime and demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? When al is done, they are faine to ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne and catche holde vpon King Henry the eightes written Wil, ſigned with his owne hande. Wel, let them take as good handfaſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as they can: but yet lette them ſhewe the ſaid Queene the ſaid original Wil. It is wel knowen, that they themſelues haue ſaid, that that to doe they can not. Yet let them at leaſt lay forth ſome authe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tical Record of the ſame. It is alſo notorious, that they can not. If then the foundation of their claime, being the Wil of ſuch a Prince, and of ſo late and freſh memorie made, neither the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, nor yet any good and worthy Recorde ſufficiently authoriſed, remaine of the ſame: by what colour wil they exclude the ſaide Queene? They muſt claime either by proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of blood, or by Charter. For the firſt, nature hath excluded them: Charter they haue none to ſhew.</p>
                  <p>They wil perchance crie out, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the loſſe and imbeaſeling of the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:7067:120"/>and ſay, that ſuch a caſualtie ſhould not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroye and extinguiſh their right. This were ſome thing perchance, if it were in a priuate ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s caſe. It were ſomewhat, if their demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d did not deſtroy the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon law, and the law of nature alſo. It were ſomewhat, if their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Charter were periſhed, or by any frau dule<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t meanes intercepted by the ſaid Quene. Vpon whom in this point it is not poſsible, to faſten any the very leaſt ſiniſter ſuſpicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It were ſomewhat, if they did not aſpire to take gaine and lucre, or if the Queene ſought not to auoide da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mage. For da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mage it is, when any perſon is ſpoiled of any right due to him by law and reaſon.

It is very probable, that in this place the ſcripture meaneth of a mere foreiner and ſtraunger, ſuch as were neither borne in Iewrie, nor of the Iewiſhe blood. For with ſuche Aliens
<pb facs="tcp:7067:129"/>they were forbidden alſo to couple in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, by reaſon they were Idolatours, and might thereby them ſelues be occaſioned (as they were oftentimes in deede) to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done and forſake their true and ſincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Such a ſtranger, I am wel aſſured, this Ladie is not to vs (if ſhe be any ſtraunger at al.) The Scotteſmen and we be al Chriſtians and of one Iland, of one tonge, and almoſt of one faſhion and manners, cuſtomes, and lawes. So that we can not in any wiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt them amongeſt ſuch kinde of ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, that this place of Moyſes mentioneth: namely the Ladie Marie the Quene of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, being not only in hart wel affectioned and minded to al Engliſhmen, as hath by many experiments ben wel knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by deſcent and Roial blood all Engliſh, whiche ſhe taketh from the noble Kinges longe before the Conqueſt, and after the Conqueſt from the worthie Princes Henry the firſt,

                  <p>Al which cauſes, with ſome other in ſuch number concurrant, ought rather to inforce
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7067:129"/>vs, to thinke and to take her, as no ſtraunger to vs, rather then to eſtraunge her from vs, by the only place of her Natiuitie, which is yet neuertheleſſe within the fower ſeas, and very nigh to England, by Oſbred, bounding at Starling bridge.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of al, touching the forſaid Chapter of Deuteronomie, we affirme, that it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, that ye ſay, aſwel that this lawe of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment bindeth our Kinges to the hauing and following of this law, as we haue ſaid (vnleſſe to omitte other thinges, ye would bind our Kinges alſo, to receaue the Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomie at the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of the Leuitical Tribe) as that ye ſay, that God gaue here a lawe to the Iewes, to make or chooſe a King: and ſo conſequently, al your illations out of this place ſeeme to be of ſmal force. For to ſay the trueth, as God neither gaue them this or any other lawe, for chooſing of a King, nor did bid or will them to chooſe a King: ſo did the people moſt greeuouſly offend God in demanding a King.</p>

                  <p>Neither was he a litle angrie with the Iewes, nor they committed any ſmal fault, but (as it were) renounced and reiected Gods owne Monarchie, in crauing a King, as holy Scripture plainely and openly teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiet:

Ye know, that as Athalias mother was a Tyria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian: ſo was Ruth a Moabite. This Ruth maried the foreſaid Booz. I aſke you now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, whether Obed the ſon of the ſaid Booz, and Ruth were Alie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the lewes?

And ſo hath Athalia at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth ſpon a faire thred for you. We deny then,
<note place="margin">4. Reg. 11.</note> that this Athalia was an Alie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Iſraelits: and therfore ſhe could not be bard fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any inheritance due vnto the daughter,
<pb facs="tcp:7067:134"/>among the Children of Iſrael. Neither was ſhe remoued from the kingdom, as this ſobre man being beſt awaked dreameth, bycauſe ſhe was a ſtraunger. But for that ſhe moſte cruelly, and vnnaturally, ſleaing and murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her Nevewes, the ſonnes of her ſonne King Othozias, lately killed by Iehu, by ſhameful meanes vſurped her ſelf the croune apperteining to her Nephew Ioas, who by the prouidence of God was (ſhe being vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of it) preſerued from her boutcherie. And after ſeuen yeares, by the help of Ioada the High Prieſt, was anointed King, and ſhe depoſed, and worthely put to death. And this cauſe doth appeare euen in the very Chapter and place, that this brauling braine doth alleage. As for the cauſe he him ſelfe proponeth, we wil not ſticke with him, to geue him a longer date, to fetche out and ſhew vs his recordes, and his authours, at his good leaſure.</p>
                  <p>Wel, this ſtring wil not ſerue his bowe: we wil therefore liſten againe to him, and conſider, how wel he harpeth vpon the next ſtring: whiche ſurely doth geue as il fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a iarring, and as vntunable a noice as the firſt, or rather more vntunable. Wherein
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7067:134"/>our good quiet brother doth ſo ſtraine and wreſt the worde, <hi>ex fratribus,</hi> among the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne: that he wreſteth away not only the right, and intereſt, that the Queene of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land pretendeth to the Succeſsion of the Croune, but doth wreſt withal the Croune from al Princes neckes that haue ben, are, or ſhalbe women. And of al ſuch as haue, do, or ſhal claime their inheritance, by th'intereſt, and title of their mothers, whiche haue no better Title, then their progenitours from whom they claime.</p>
                  <p>For amongeſt his new notable notes, that he noteth out of this ſeuententh Chapter of Deuteronomie, for the chooſing of a King, we may note (ſaith he) the ſexe, by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſculine gendre, vſed in this worde <hi>ex fratri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus:</hi> for vnder the other ſexe, <hi>Ataxia</hi> moſt commonly creepeth into the ſtocke and Countrie.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith alſo afterward, this politique law, that God did geue the Iewes, is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the law of Nature, and is alſo as euerlaſting, as Nature it ſelfe is, and is of all natural men to be obſerued.

                  <p>Neither wil this euaſion relieue you) (that ſome of your affinitie, for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of this ſo wrong an opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue vſed) that this is but one bare and an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie priuileged and perſonal example, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing none other the like in Scripture.
<note place="margin">One onely example in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture a ſufficient preſident.</note> And therefore not to be drawen, to make therof a rule or preſident for womanly gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. If this your replie be effectual, then farewel the Baptiſme of yong children, whereof it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7067:150"/>wilbe harde to find more then one, if that one example may be found in al the holy Scripture. Then farewel a numbre of rights, Ceremonies, cuſtomes, and orders, aſwel in eccleſiaſtical, as in political affaires, al which haue but one, and ſome no one exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple at al therein. Yet it ſo being, that the vſe thereof is not repugnant to the ſaid holy Scriptures: they haue ben, they are, and may wel here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be kept, vſed and obſerued.</p>
                  <p>And yet I know no cauſe, but that the worthy Iudith may be another example al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo:

Whereby it wil follow by good reaſon, that in caſe ſhe had ben the Gouerneſſe of al the people, her gouerment

In caſe ye ſay, ſhe ſhal not: the plaine wordes of the ſcripture euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly do reproue you.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7067:151"/>foliſh gloſſe. Whervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I do inferre,
<note place="margin">It ſeemeth by the rules and vvordes of holie Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that a vvorma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may haue Ciuil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly gouernment is admitted, not only by theſe exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, but euen by the very wordes, rules, and decrees of holy Scripture. And ſo I truſt you are, or haue cauſe to be fully ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, aſwel touching your allegatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly Regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is againſt nature, as alſo tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g a brother to be choſen king. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude againſt you, that neither the law of God, nor of Nature, nor yet reaſon, (vpon the which alſo you ground yourſelf) doe reiect the ſaid Queene Marie from the ſucceſsion of the Croune of England.</p>
                  <p>You reaſon, that where the people erect themſelf an Head of their owne kinde and Nation, there nature aſſureth the people of natural gouernment: and where a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger carieth opinion of vnnatural tyranny, it aſſureth the ruler of vnnatural ſubiection. To a ſtraunger is murmurre, and rebellion threatned. But now if this excellent La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and Princeſſe be no ſtraunger, and be of our owne kinred, and of the auncient and late Roial bloud of this Realme (as we haue declared) then is your reaſon alſo withal auoided, which may and doth ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times take place in more ſtraungers, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming in by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb facs="tcp:7067:152"/>and forceable meanes. But here, as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural a man, as you make your ſelf, ye ſeeme to goe altogether againſt reaſon, and againſt nature alſo. If Princes Children were to be counted ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers and Aliens, or to be ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted as enemies and Tyrantes ſucceding to their owne Progenitours inheritance, it was an vnnatural parte, and a great folie in the noble Kinges of this and of many other Realmes, to geue out their daughters to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine Princes in mariage. And in ſteade of preferring and aduancing them by their mariage, and procuring thereby frindſhip and amitie with other Princes, to diſable their ſaid children from ther Aunceſtours inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces in thoſe Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries, from whence they originally proceded. And as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by your kind of reaſoning, to purchaſe and procure byſide to them thereby an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of enmitie and tyrannie.</p>
                  <p>This, this, I ſay, is a frowarde and an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural interpretation. Nature moueth and driueth vs, to think otherwiſe, and that both a Prince wil fauour, loue and cheriſhe the people, from whence he fetcheth his roial blood, and by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he muſt now mainteine, keepe, and defende his roial eſtate, and that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7067:152"/>the people likewiſe wil beare ſinguler loue and affection to ſuch a one, ſpecially of ſuch knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Princely qualities, as this noble La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is adorned withal.
<note place="margin">The Q. of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land no ſtranger to Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</note> Surely it is no more vnnatural to ſuch a Prince, deſcending from the anncient and late roial blood of the Kinges of England, to beare rule in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and as it were to returne to the head and fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine, from whence originally ſhe ſpra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g: then it is for al fluddes and riuers which (as Homer ſaith) flow out of the great Ocea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſea, <gap reason="foreign">
